# **TuneGenie â€“ Spotify Playlist Recommender & Analyzer** ðŸŽ§  

Welcome to my Spotify ELT Pipeline repository! ðŸŽ¶

As both a data enthusiast and a daily Spotify listener, I created this project to explore the power of modern data platforms while diving into music analytics. This project showcases how to build a fully automated ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) pipeline using real-time data from the Spotify API, orchestrated with Apache Airflow and powered by Snowflake.

## Overview  

This project outlines the design and implementation of a cloud-based ELT pipeline that transforms raw Spotify data into a format ready for recommendation systems and analytical insights. The pipeline consists of multiple stages including data extraction, loading into Snowflake, transformation using SQL, and feature engineering â€” all automated via Airflow.

## Project Components  

**1. Data Extraction**

Extract Spotify data using a Python script (`crawl.py`) from:

- Artists metadata
- Track metadata
- Synthetic data of listening history

**2. Data Loading**

Raw structured data is loaded into **Snowflake**â€™s **Raw Data Layer**, enabling scalable, cloud-based storage and analysis.

**3. Data Transformation**

Using dbt Core, the data is cleaned and enriched:

- Deduplication, null handling
- Type casting & encoding
- Feature enrichment (e.g., audio stats, genre behavior)

**4. Workflow Orchestration**

Using **Apache Airflow** (dbt Cloud for current stage), the pipeline is scheduled and automated with:

- Clear DAGs and task dependencies
- Logging and retry logic

**5. Analytics & Recommendation**

- Playlist trend analysis
- Genre & artist clustering
- Content-based and collaborative recommendation logic
